# event.preventDefault(tic-tac-toe): A Description
This application allows the user to play a classic game of tic-tac-toe using the latest advancements in programming to create a smooth user experience. The user can sign up to the play game, then once signed up and signed in via authentication, the user is able to start a new game.  The user can then go into the game board and make moves on the gameboard that leverage the latest DOM manipulation strategies to create a dynamic game play experience. The user can select from open tiles on the gameboard, and will be alerted when there is a winner, or the game ends in tie.  At which point the game will be over, and the user can select to start a new game or logout.

The user can elect to change a password via authentication.  The user can also view the number of tic-tac-toe games played. The strategies employed in creating the game will provide the user with capability to use the app on a mobile device or a laptop without compromising the in-app experience.  The dynamic code base will allow users to interact with the app as they would a native app on their mobile device.

### Unsolved Problems

I initially attemped to create a more effecient way to feed the API winning combinations.  I prepared an array with the 8 winning combinations, and tried to determine a winner in that fashion.  However, the logic behind this way proved to be greater than my skill level at the present moment.

One large hurdle to unsolved propblems is the balancing act within ones self between expectations and reality. I noticed that much of my creative energy, if left unchecked was geared towards the "expectations" bubble.  When in actuality, I was most productive when my creative energies were neutral between expecation and reality, or even leaning more towards reality. Many problems that I faced, I spent much time pondering ways to solve them that possibly don't even exist. There is hope, I see that one can be a creative pragmatist, and then a creative idealist when the time calls for it, only through exhaustive planning and powerful self-discipline.
